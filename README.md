# My Portfolio and React Practice

I wanted to get a portfolio up in a limited amount of time. I also wanted to explore using React. I found this [template](https://github.com/mshuber1981/github-react-portfolio-template/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file) and it fit the bill perfectly.

I appreciate the accessibility and the documentation. Plus, the layout and overall design is clear and uncomplicated, which means implmenting my edits was pretty simple â€“ even when I went beyond the built in customization options.

Check out the original [template](https://github.com/mshuber1981/github-react-portfolio-template/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file) by @mshuber1981, it's a nice project.

## Background
While I have several years of experience working with Ruby and Angular, at the time of starting this project it had been almost three years since I had spent any significant amount of time writing code.

I felt ~~a bit~~ incredibly rusty and intimidated. Sometimes feeling like I forgot everything. Not true, but it felt that way. 

Besides wanting to start a project and get my coding confidence back up, I was also curious about React because I hadn't worked with it much. I thought it would be good practice to work my way through the documentatation and component architecture.

## Customizations
- New fonts
- New SiteCredits section component
- Various styling adjustments

## TODOs
I plan to:
- submit an issue for a bug I found in ProjectCard component
- make the site tab navigable
- add tests (at least integration tests)
